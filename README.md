Introduction
This project is a microservices-based application developed using Spring Boot. It serves as a practical example of building a scalable and maintainable microservice architecture.

Project Overview
Several microservices are created and interconnected to form a complete system. Here's an overview of the key components and services covered:

Microservices: The project consists of multiple microservices, each responsible for specific functionalities.
User Service: Manages user registration and authentication.
Product Service: Handles product catalog and inventory management.
Order Service: Manages customer orders and order processing.
Payment Service: Processes payments for orders.
Communication: Microservices communicate with each other using RESTful APIs and message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) to ensure loose coupling and reliability.
Service Discovery: Eureka Server is used for service registration and discovery to enable dynamic scaling and load balancing.
API Gateway: A gateway service (e.g., Netflix Zuul) acts as the entry point for clients and routes requests to the appropriate microservice.
Distributed Tracing: Zipkin or other distributed tracing tools are employed to monitor and trace requests as they traverse the microservices.
Databases: Each microservice may use its own database, and data consistency is maintained through eventual consistency patterns.
Containerization: Docker is used to containerize microservices for consistency and easy deployment.
Orchestration: Kubernetes or another container orchestration platform may be used to manage and scale containers.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD) are set up to automate testing and deployment processes.
Security: Spring Security and OAuth2 are implemented for securing microservices and user authentication.


Best Practices
The following best practices were demonstrated in the video tutorial:

Microservices Design: Each microservice has a single responsibility and communicates via well-defined APIs.
Containerization: Microservices are containerized for consistency and scalability.
Service Discovery: Eureka Server enables dynamic service registration and discovery.
API Gateway: An API gateway handles client requests and routes them to the appropriate microservice.
Distributed Tracing: Distributed tracing tools help monitor and trace requests across microservices.
Database Independence: Each microservice manages its own database, promoting independence and isolation.
Eventual Consistency: Data consistency is maintained through eventual consistency patterns.
CI/CD: Automated CI/CD pipelines ensure smooth testing and deployment.
Security: Spring Security and OAuth2 are used for securing microservices and user authentication.


Technologies Used
The project leverages the following technologies:

Spring Boot: A Java-based framework for building microservices.
Docker: Containerization technology for packaging microservices.
Eureka Server: Service discovery and registration.
Netflix Zuul: API gateway for routing requests.
RabbitMQ: Message queue for communication.
Zipkin: Distributed tracing for monitoring.
Spring Security: Securing microservices and user authentication.
OAuth2: Authentication and authorization framework.
Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or another database system.
CI/CD: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or another CI/CD tool.
Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform (optional).
Git: Version control for source code management.


Access the services, API documentation, and other resources based on the URLs and ports.

Project Structure
The project is structured as a collection of microservices, each residing in its own directory. Each microservice typically follows a similar structure, including source code, configuration files, and Dockerfile for containerization.

Features
This microservices project showcases a range of features including user authentication, product management,order processing, payment handling, and more.
